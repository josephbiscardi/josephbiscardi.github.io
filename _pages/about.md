Hello all, and welcome to my page! I am Joseph Biscardi, a graduate of East Carolina University with a Bachelors of Science in Information Computer Technology with a security concentration. My hobbies include sports, blogging about new products and technologies and gaming. I also enjoy working with hardware and software - building PCs or setting up switches/routers and writing scripts and project-based code. I run my own homelab and dedicate time perfecting my craft. I grew up in Rochester, NY and currently reside in Greenville, North Carolina. 

I am currently employed at Metallix Refining as an IT Systems Specialist. I work with all different components of IT from networking, firewalls and security to system administration. During my time after college, I have developed skills and knowledge on SonicWALL and Fortigate firewalls, Unifi products, Windows Server, Linux Server and cybersecurity. I am continuing to adapt and advance my knowledge about IT as a whole.
