Hello all, and welcome to my page! I am Joseph Biscardi. I am currently employed as a IT Systems Specialist. My hobbies include sports, blogging about new products and technologies and gaming. I also enjoy working with hardware and software - building PCs or setting up switches/routers and writing scripts and project-based code. I run my own homelab and dedicate time perfecting my craft. 

When I am not online, I like to be with friends & family trying new foods or visiting new places. I love experiencing the cultures, cuisine and people. This led me to becoming a freelance travel agent. 

Please enjoy my personal site!
