Hello all, and welcome to my page! I am Joseph Biscardi. My hobbies include sports, blogging about new products and technologies and gaming. I also enjoy working with hardware and software - building PCs or setting up switches/routers and writing scripts and project-based code. I run my own homelab and dedicate time perfecting my craft.

I am currently employed as a IT Systems Specialist
